# Design Philosophy

moltbot-safe is built on these principles:

## Minimalism
Only essential features are included. No unnecessary abstractions or hidden behaviors.

## Explicitness
All permissions, actions, and execution paths are explicit. No implicit or default capabilities.

## Isolation
All agent actions occur inside a sandbox. No access to the broader system.

## Least Privilege
Agents are granted only the permissions they need—nothing more.

## Transparency
Every action, allowed or denied, is logged for traceability.

## Predictability
No hidden side effects. All behavior is documented and testable.

## Auditability
Logs and permission checks are easy to review and verify.


moltbot-safe is built on the following principles:

## Minimalism

Only essential features are included to reduce complexity and attack surface.

## Explicit Permissions

Agents must be granted explicit permissions for every action they perform.

## Isolation

All agent actions are sandboxed to prevent unintended side effects.

## Transparency

Every action is logged, including denied attempts, for full traceability.

## Auditability

Logs and permission checks are designed to be easily reviewed and verified.

## Extensibility

The system is modular, making it easy to add new features without compromising safety.


All agent actions occur inside a sandbox.  
This is non-negotiable.

Isolation ensures:

- No accidental file access  
- No privilege escalation  
- No system-wide side effects  
- No surprises  

The sandbox is the boundary between “agent world” and “real world.”

# 4. Least Privilege

Agents receive only the permissions they absolutely need.

- No broad access  
- No default permissions  
- No “just in case” capabilities  

Every permission must be:

- intentional  
- documented  
- justified  

This principle prevents overreach and reduces blast radius.

---

# 5. Transparency

A safe system must be observable.

- Every action is logged  
- Every denial is logged  
- Every error is logged  

Transparency creates:

- trust  
- accountability  
- debuggability  
- forensic traceability  

If it isn’t logged, it didn’t happen.

---

# 6. Predictability

The engine should behave the same way every time.

- No nondeterministic behavior  
- No hidden state  
- No silent fallbacks  

Predictability is essential for safety, testing, and reasoning about agent behavior.

# 7. No Autonomy by Default

**moltbot-safe** is intentionally *not* an autonomous agent.

It is:

- an execution substrate  
- a permissioned action engine  
- a safe boundary layer  

It is **not**:

- a planner  
- a decision-maker  
- a reasoning model  

Intelligence layers may be added on top, but the engine itself remains dumb, safe, and predictable.

---

# 8. Composability

The system should be easy to integrate with:

- LLMs  
- planners  
- rule-based systems  
- human-in-the-loop workflows  

But integration must never compromise safety.

The engine is a component, not a monolith.

---

# 9. Auditability

Every part of the system should be easy to inspect.

- Small modules  
- Clear code paths  
- Declarative configs  
- Human-readable logs  

Auditability is a core requirement, not an afterthought.

---

# 10. Safety Over Capability

If forced to choose between:

- adding a powerful feature  
- maintaining safety guarantees  

The project will always choose safety.

This is the defining principle of **moltbot-safe**.

---

# Summary

**moltbot-safe** is a deliberately minimal, explicit, isolated, permissioned, transparent, predictable, and auditable execution engine for AI agents.  
These principles guide every design decision and ensure the system remains safe, trustworthy, and easy to reason about.

Future contributors should treat this document as the north star for all development.
