This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of **moltbot-safe**, a minimal, permissioned, sandboxed execution engine for AI agents.  
The goal is to maintain a clear, safe, and auditable foundation while gradually expanding capabilities in a controlled, transparent way.

---

# 1. Core Stability (Current Phase)

### ✅ Establish minimal execution engine
- Basic action execution inside sandbox  
- Schema validation  
- Permission enforcement  
- Audit logging  

### ✅ Documentation foundation
- README  
- SECURITY policy  
- CONTRIBUTING guidelines  
- Code of Conduct  
- Architecture overview  
- Threat model  

### 🎯 Goals
- Ensure the core is predictable, testable, and safe  
- Maintain minimalism and explicitness  

---

# 2. Safety Enhancements

### 🔒 Permission System Improvements
- More granular permission scopes  
- Resource-level constraints (file types, size limits, path patterns)  
- Optional capability tokens for fine-grained control  

### 🧪 Validation Hardening
- Fuzz testing for action schema  
- Strict type and structure enforcement  
- Reject ambiguous or multi-step actions  

### 🛡️ Audit Log Integrity
- Optional cryptographic signing  
- Log rotation and archival  
- Tamper-evident formatting  

---

# 3. Sandbox Extensions

### 📁 Filesystem Sandbox
- Read/write quotas  
- File type restrictions  
- Temporary file isolation  

### 🌐 Network Sandbox (Optional)
- Explicit allowlist for domains  
- Rate limiting  
- DNS isolation  

### ⚙️ Subprocess Sandbox
- Restricted subprocess execution  
- Timeouts and resource limits  
- No shell access by default  

---

# 4. Developer Experience

### 🧰 Tooling
- CLI utilities for testing actions  
- Permission configuration validator  
- Audit log viewer  

### 📚 Examples
- Example agents using the engine  
- Example permission configurations  
- Example sandboxed workflows  

### 🧪 Test Suite
- Unit tests for all modules  
- Integration tests for sandbox behavior  
- Regression tests for denied actions  

---

# 5. Integrations

### 🧠 Reasoning Layer Interfaces
While *moltbot-safe* intentionally contains **no intelligence**, future versions may include:

- A stable API for connecting planners or LLMs  
- A safe “action proposal” interface  
- Human-in-the-loop confirmation hooks  

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture
- Optional modules for new action types  
- Community-driven extensions  
- Strict review for safety compliance  

---

# 6. Long-Term Vision

### 🌐 A Standard for Safe Agent Execution
The long-term goal is for **moltbot-safe** to become:

- A reference implementation for safe agent substrates  
- A minimal, auditable foundation for research and production  
- A counterpoint to overly powerful or opaque agent systems  

### 🧩 Interoperability
- Support for multiple agent frameworks  
- Declarative capability negotiation  
- Portable permission profiles  

---

# 7. Guiding Principles (Always)

- **Minimalism over complexity**  
- **Explicitness over inference**  
- **Isolation over trust**  
- **Transparency over convenience**  
- **Safety over capability**  

---

# 8. Contributing to the Roadmap

Contributors are encouraged to propose roadmap items via:

- GitHub Issues  
- Discussions  
- Pull Requests  

All proposals should include safety considerations and alignment with the project’s philosophy.

---

**moltbot-safe** will evolve carefully, deliberately, and transparently — always prioritizing safety and clarity over feature creep.
